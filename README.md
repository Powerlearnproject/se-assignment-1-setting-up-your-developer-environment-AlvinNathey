## Assignment: Setting Up Your Developer Environment

### Objective:
This assignment aims to familiarize you with the tools and configurations necessary to set up an efficient developer environment for software engineering projects. Completing this assignment will give you the skills required to set up a robust and productive workspace conducive to coding, debugging, version control, and collaboration.

### Tasks:

1. **Select Your Operating System (OS):**
   - **Choose an operating system that best suits your preferences and project requirements.**
     - I have chosen Windows 11 as my operating system.
   - **Download and Install Windows 11:** [Windows 11 Download](https://www.microsoft.com/software-download/windows11)

2. **Install a Text Editor or Integrated Development Environment (IDE):**
   - **Select and install a text editor or IDE suitable for your programming languages and workflow.**
     - I have chosen Visual Studio Code as my IDE.
   - **Download and Install Visual Studio Code:** [Visual Studio Code Download](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download)

3. **Set Up Version Control System:**
   - **Install Git and configure it on your local machine.**
     - I downloaded and installed Git from [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
     - Configured Git with the following commands:
       ```sh
       git config --global user.name "Your Name"
       git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
       ```
   - **Create a GitHub account for hosting your repositories:** [GitHub](https://github.com)
   - **Initialize a Git repository for your project and make your first commit:**
     ```sh
     git init
     echo "# MyProject" >> README.md
     git add README.md
     git commit -m "Initial commit"
     git branch -M main
     git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git
     git push -u origin main
     ```

4. **Install Necessary Programming Languages and Runtimes:**
   - **Install Python:** [Python Download](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
   - Verify installation with:
     ```sh
     python --version
     ```

5. **Install Package Managers:**
   - **Install pip (Python's package manager):**
     - Pip is included with Python 3.4 and later. Verify with:
       ```sh
       pip --version
       ```

6. **Configure a Database (MySQL):**
   - **Download and install MySQL database:** [MySQL Download](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/windows/installer/5.7.html)
   - Follow the installation wizard to set up MySQL on your machine.

7. **Set Up Development Environments and Virtualization (Optional):**
   - Consider using virtualization tools like Docker or virtual machines.
   - **Install Docker:** [Docker Download](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)

8. **Explore Extensions and Plugins:**
   - **Visual Studio Code Extensions:**
     - **Python:** For Python development.
     - **GitLens:** For Git integration.
     - **Prettier:** Code formatter.
     - **ESLint:** For JavaScript linting.
     - Install extensions through the Extensions view in Visual Studio Code.

9. **Document Your Setup:**
   - **Create a comprehensive document outlining the steps you've taken to set up your developer environment.**
     - Include any configurations, customizations, or troubleshooting steps encountered during the process.

### Deliverables:

1. **Setup Documentation:**
   - A document detailing the setup process with step-by-step instructions and screenshots where necessary.

2. **GitHub Repository:**
   - A repository containing a sample project initialized with Git and any necessary configuration files (e.g., .gitignore).

3. **Reflection:**
   - A reflection on the challenges faced during setup and strategies employed to overcome them.

### Submission:
Submit your document and GitHub repository link through the designated platform or email to the instructor by the specified deadline.

### Evaluation Criteria:

- **Completeness and accuracy of setup documentation.**
- **Effectiveness of version control implementation.**
- **Appropriateness of tools selected for the project requirements.**
- **Clarity of reflection on challenges and solutions encountered.**
- **Adherence to submission guidelines and deadlines.**

### Reflection:
During the setup process, I faced challenges such as configuring Git and setting up the MySQL database. For Git, I followed online tutorials and documentation to understand the necessary commands. For MySQL, I encountered issues with service startup but resolved them by checking the error logs and ensuring the correct configuration settings.
